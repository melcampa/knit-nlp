specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. The needle
or hook size called for in the pattern is based on what the designer used, but it is not unusual
for gauge to vary from person to person. If it takes you fewer stitches and rows to make your
swatch, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size
hook or needles.
