GAUGE:
24 sts + 28 rows = 4" [10 cm] in St st (k every rnd) on larger needles. BE SURE TO
CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the
size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient.
If it takes you less stitches and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm] square, try using a
smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or
needles.
SOCK
With smaller needles and A, cast on 40 sts. Divide sts evenly onto 4 needles, being careful not to twist. Place marker for beginning of
rnd. Work in k1, p1 rib for 2½ in. [6.5 cm]. Change to larger needles and St st (k every rnd). Work 6 rnds each in B, A, and C. Change
to A, and work in St st until piece measures 6 in. [15 cm] from beg.
