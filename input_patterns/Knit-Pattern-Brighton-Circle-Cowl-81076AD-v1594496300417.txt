GAUGE:
12 sts + 16 rnds = 4 in. (10 cm) in St st worked in the rnd (k every rnd) with 1 strand
each of A and B held tog and larger needle. BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When
you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern
and the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you less stitches
and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm] square, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if
more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.

1) Sections 2 and 3 of the Cowl begin by picking up sts along the bound-off edge of
the previous section.
2) To increase, k into A strand of next st, then k into B strand of same st – 1 st
increased.
