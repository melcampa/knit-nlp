GAUGE:
4 stitches = 4 in. [10 cm] in Stockinette stitch (knit on right side rows, purl on wrong
side rows) with 4 strands of yarn held together.
NOTE Due to the nature of the fabric when working with Speed Stix, gauge may vary
throughout the knitting and is not crucial to this project.
BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the gauge in a pattern, your
project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the
pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you less stitches and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm]
square, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a
larger size hook or needles.
THROW
With 1 strand each of A, B, C, and D held together, cast on 34 stitches.
Row 1 (right side): Knit.
Row 2:Purl.
Repeat Rows 1 and 2 until piece measures 54 in. [137 cm] from beginning. Bind off.
FINISHING
Weave in ends.
Fringe
Cut 68 strands of each color yarn each about 20 in. [52 cm] long. For each Fringe, hold one strand of each
color (4 strands total) together and fold in half. Use crochet hook to draw fold through edge of Afghan,
forming a loop. Pull ends of Fringe through this loop. Pull to tighten. Make one Fringe in each stitch along first
and last rows of Throw. Trim Fringe ends evenly.
