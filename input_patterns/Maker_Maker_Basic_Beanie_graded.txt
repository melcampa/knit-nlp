Pattern – Flat
Cuff
Using straight needles, cast on 62 [72, 78, 92, 98, 106, 118] sts.
Row 1 (RS): k1, (k1, p1) to end, k1.
Row 2 (WS): p1, (k1, p1) to end, p1.
Repeat these two rows until cuff measures 2 [2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4, 5]cm from cast on (straight cuff), or 4 [5, 6, 7, 8, 8,
10]cm from cast on (folded cuff), or desired length.
Sizes 6-9, 12-18 and XL: k1, kfb, knit to end. 1 stitch increased. (- [-, 79, 93, -, -, 119]sts)
Sides
Row 1 (RS): knit to end.
Row 2 (WS): purl to end.
Repeat until hat measures either 5 [6.5, 8, 9.5, 12, 13, 16]cm from cast on edge (straight cuff), or 7 [9, 11, 13, 16, 17,
20]cm from cast on (folded cuff), or desired length.
Crown Shaping
Decrease row: (k8 [8, 9, 11, 10, 11, 11], k2tog) to last 2 sts, k2. 6 [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9] sts decreased.
Next row: purl to end.
Repeat these two rows, working 1 less stitch before the k2tog in each new repeat, and still decreasing the same
number of stitches each time, until you have 20 [23, 23, 23, 26, 26, 29]sts.
Next row: (k1, k2tog) to last 2 sts, k2. (14 [16, 16, 16, 18, 18, 20]sts.)
Next row: p2, (p2tog) to end. (8 [9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11]sts.)
Cut yarn leaving a long tail. Thread this tail through the remaining live stitches using your yarn needle starting at
the opposite end of stitches (to create a circle), then take the knitting needle out and pull to close. Fasten off, and
seam sides using Mattress Stitch. Weave in ends.

Techniques (when working in the round)
- This pattern requires either the use of Magic Loop or double pointed needles for the crown shaping. If you
haven't done Magic Loop before, there are many great videos online!
- Join for working in the round. There are many ways to join in the round. You can simply just start knitting, starting
with the first stitch that you cast on, or here is a slightly neater method: Cast on 1 extra stitch than written in the
pattern. Then work pattern (in our case 1x1 rib) to last stitch, slip last stitch onto left needle, then begin the next
round with a k2tog and continue as written.
- I also find that you can knit a few rows of the ribbing flat, and then join. This makes it much less likely to twist your
stitches! Just use the yarn tail to join the gap later.
- Continue to slip the stitch marker along as you get to it.
Pattern – In the Round
Hat
Using circular needles, cast on 60 [70, 76, 90, 96, 104, 116] sts, join for working in the round, making sure the work
isn't twisted, and place the stitch marker to mark the beginning.
Ribbing: (k1, p1) to end.
Repeat until cuff measures 2 [2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4, 5]cm from cast on (straight cuff), or 4 [5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 10]cm from cast on
(folded cuff), or desired length.
Sizes 6-9, 12-18 and XL: kfb, knit to end. 1 stitch increased. (- [-, 77, 91, -, -, 117]sts)
Now knit every round until hat measures either 5 [6.5, 8, 9.5, 12, 13, 16]cm from cast on edge (straight cuff), or 7 [9,
11, 13, 16, 17, 20]cm from cast on (folded cuff), or desired length.
Crown Shaping
You will now be decreasing stitches and will need to use Magic Loop or DPN's if you haven't been using them
already.
Decrease round: (k8 [8, 9, 11, 10, 11, 11], k2tog), to end. 6 [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9] sts decreased.
Next round: knit to end.
Repeat these two rounds, working 1 less stitch before the k2tog in each new repeat, and still decreasing the same
number of stitches each time, until you have 18 [21, 21, 21, 24, 24, 27]sts.
Next round: (k1, k2tog) to end. (12 [14, 14, 14, 16, 16, 18]sts.)
Next round: k2tog to end. (6 [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]sts.)

Cut yarn leaving a long tail. Thread this tail through the remaining live stitches using your yarn needle, taking the
knitting needles out as you go, and pull to close. Fasten off, and weave in both ends.
