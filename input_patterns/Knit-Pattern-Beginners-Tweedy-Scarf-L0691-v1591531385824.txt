GAUGE:
18 stitches + 22 rows = 4 in. (10 cm) in pattern. BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match
the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified
in the pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you less stitches and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm] square,
try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
