GAUGE:
12 stitches + 19 rows = 4 in. (10 cm) in Garter stitch (knit every stitch on every row) with
2 strands of yarn held together. BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the
gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials
specified in the pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you less stitches and rows to make a 4
in. [10 cm] square, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a
larger size hook or needles.
