This pattern is a basic beanie pattern, put together to use up my scraps to knit warm beanies for some of
Melbourne’s refugees. The hat comes in six sizes, from baby through to large adult. Make them in any size,
and they will be gratefully received and will keep someone warm this winter.

Needles:
• 4mm (US#6) 40cm (16”) circular needle and dpns – or size required to reach gauge. The smallest size
may need to be worked on dpns or with magic loop; and
• 3.5mm (US#4) 40cm (16”) circular needle – or two sizes smaller than those for gauge.
Gauge: 22sts/10cm(4”) in stocking stitch, using larger needles.

CCCCaaaasssstttt OOOOnnnn::::
Using smaller needles, cast on 72, 80, (88, 96), 104, 112 sts. Being careful not to twist, join in the round and
place marker for EoR.
Ribbing: [k2, p2] repeat around.
Work a further 7, 7, (9, 9), 11, 11 rounds in ribbing pattern as set, for a total of 8, 8, (10, 10), 12, 12 ribbing
rounds.
Change to larger needles, and knit round. Continue to knit every round, until hat measures:
9.5, 11, (12, 13.5), 14, 14.5cm, or
3.75, 4.25, (4.75, 5.25), 5.5, 5.75”, from the cast-on edge.
Crown Decrease Set-up Round – 8sts decreased:
Baby: [k7, k2tog, pm] repeat around
Toddler: [k8, k2tog, pm] repeat around
Younger Child: [k9, k2tog, pm] repeat around
Older Child: [k10, k2tog, pm] repeat around
Small Adult: [k11, k2tog, pm] repeat around
Large Adult: [k12, k2tog, pm] repeat around
R1: Knit one round.
R2: [Knit to 2sts before marker, k2tog] repeat around – 8sts decreased.
Repeat R1 and R2 until 32sts remain, changing to dpns when necessary. Then work R2 only until 8sts
remain. Break yarn and drawn through the stitches, tighten the loop and sew in the end securely.
FFFFiiiinnnniiiisssshhhhiiiinnnngggg::::
Sew in the ends securely. Optional: wet block over a balloon to even out colourwork and stripes.
OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss::::
Use up more scraps by working stripe sequences or simple colourwork.
Jogless Stripes Method:
This method prevents the little step that happens when changing colours with stripes in the round.
R1: Knit to marker.
R2: Remove marker, slip 1 stitch, replace marker, then knit to marker. The EoR marker moves by one stitch
each colour change.
Continue knitting the stripe until it’s the desired thickness. Repeat R1 and R2 for each colour change.
