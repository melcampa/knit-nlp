GAUGE:
8 stitches + 12 rows = 4 inches (10 cm) in Garter Stitch (knit every row). When you match the
gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified
in the pattern will be sufficient. The needle or hook size called for in the pattern is based on what
the designer used, but it is not unusual for gauge to vary from person to person. If it takes you
fewer stitches and rows to make your swatch, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more
stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
Making a Gauge Swatch
NOTES:
Scarf is worked holding 1 strand each of Homespun and Fun Fur together throughout.
SCARF
With 1 strand of each yarn held together, make a slip knot. Cast on 9 stitches – a total of 10 stitches.
Work in Garter Stitch on those 10 stitches until you have about 1 yard of Fun Fur left. Bind off loosely. Weave in ends.
