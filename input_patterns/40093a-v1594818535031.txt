due to the textures of the skein.
GAUGE:
12 stitches + 16 rows = 4 inches (10 cm) in Garter Stitch (knit every row).
When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and
the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. The needle or hook size called for in the
pattern is based on what the designer used, but it is not unusual for gauge to vary from person to
person. If it takes you fewer stitches and rows to make your swatch, try using a smaller size hook
or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
Making a Gauge Swatch
SCARF
With 2 strands of Fun Fur held together, make a slip knot. Cast on 17 stitches – a total of 18 stitches.
Work in Garter Stitch on those 18 stitches for 10 inches.
Cut Fun Fur and begin knitting with Chenille Thick & Quick. Continue in Garter Stitch until 10 inches less than desired
length of Scarf or until there is not enough Chenille Thick & Quick for another complete row.
With 2 strands of Fun Fur held together, continue in Garter Stitch for 10 inches. Bind off loosely. Weave in ends.
