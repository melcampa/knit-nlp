GAUGE:
19 sts = 4 in. (10 cm) in Woven st pattern.
BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the
size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you
fewer stitches and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm] square, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if
more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
