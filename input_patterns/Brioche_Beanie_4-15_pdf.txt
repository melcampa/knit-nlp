Needles:

Size US #8, 16” circular needles (one size larger
Brioche. Although the pattern is titled basic, this
than yarn label recommendation for CO)
may be considered an intermediate level pattern
Size US #5, 16” circular needles, (two sizes smaller
because knowledge of stitch construction,
than yarn label recommendation for beanie)
and research about Brioche is helpful.

Abbreviations: CO=cast on CC= contrasting color MC= main color k = knit p= purl
k2tog=knit 2 stitches together Rnd/s=round/s sl= slip all stitches purlwise st/s=stitch/es
BrK= brioche knit BrP= brioche purl BrK2tog= brioche knit 2stitches together
sl,yof=slip one stitch, yarn over&forward yf, slyo=yarn forward, slip one stitch&yarn over needle
Special Stitches:
BrK = brioche knit,“bark”= Knit the MCslipped stitch together with its CCyarn over.
BrP = brioche purl, “burp”= Purl the CCslipped stitch together with its MCyarn over.
BrK2tog = brioche knit 2 stitches together = MCslipped stitch and CCyarn over are considered one
stitch, together with the CCpurl (you'll have 3 loops), knit those “2” stitches together.
yf, slyo = Bring the MCworking yarn under the needle to the front of the work, slip the CCstitch
purlwise. Then bring the MCyarn over the needle(and over the CCslipped stitch)to the back, ready to
work the BrK. This “yf,slyo” is considered one stitch.
sl, yof = slip one stitch, yarn over&forward = With the CCyarn already in front, slip the MCstitch
purlwise, then bring the CCyarn over the needle(and over the MCslipped stitch), and under the needle
to the front, ready to work the BrP. This “sl, yof” is considered one stitch.
Resources/ Research:
(I found “2- Color Brioche Knitting on Circular Needles”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=tgRgfCgQTPA; to be very helpful. If you knit continental, watch Brioche Stitch with Nancy Wynn:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TjJelUaxog.)
Knitting Brioche, by Nancy Marchant is an excellent resource for inspiration and getting started.
Knitting Without Tears, by Elizabeth Zimmerman, p95-97, A Watchcap is knit in the flat, but offers a
quick look into Brioche.
Directions: Directions are written for size adult [child, infant are in brackets] (Notes are in italic)
With MC, size US#8needles, use the long-tail cast-on method, loosely cast on 72 [64, 56] stitches.
Place marker & join together by knitting first stitch being careful not to twist.
Continue with MC, size US#5needles, knit one round.
Set up round:
With size US#5needles, leave MC in back, introduce/pull CC to front, * sl, yof, p1; repeat to end.
(With CCyarn toward the front, slip MCstitch, bring CCyarn over needle and to the front, purl 1 stitch)
Hat: (Work hat with size US#5needles)
Rnd 1: with MC, * BrK, yf, slyo; repeat to end
(MC BrK, MCyarn forward, slip CCstitch and bring MCyarn over top needle, ready to BrK again.)
(The very last stitch of the round: MCyarn forward, slip CCstitch, and the MC will just flop)
Rnd 2: with CC in front, * Sl, yof, BrP; repeat to end
(with CCyarn in front, slip MCstitch, bring CCyarn over needle and to the front, CC BrP)
(The very last stitch of the round: be sure to hold-up the floppy MCstitch to work the BrP. Then tuck
the MCyarn under the needle tips, ready to slip the marker, and BrK the first stitch of the next round.)
Complete Hat rounds 1- 2 until hat reaches desired height,11” [9”, 7”] ending on rnd 2.
(Work hat with Brioche rounds 1 & 2 for 11”[ 9”, 7”] ending on rnd 2.
For a shorter “cap”, work fewer rounds of Brioche before starting the crown. This pattern has a
quick crown decrease, adding no height to the finished hat.)
Crown Decreases as follows: (Work stitches on double pointed needles when needed.)
Rnd 1: with MC, BrK 1, *BrK2tog; repeat from * to end, k1 (the last purl stitch)
(MC BrK just once, then repeat BrK2tog = brioche knit 2 stitches together = MCslipped stitch and
CCyarn over are considered one stitch, together with the CCpurl (you'll have 3 loops), knit those “2”
stitches together. Repeat to the end, but you'll find one remaining purl, knit that stitch.)
Rnd 2: Remove marker, with MC, *K2tog; repeat from * until 10sts remain.
Finishing: Cut 12” yarn and thread end through remaining 10 stitches.
Pull together, and tie off neatly for a very reversible hat. Weave in ends.
