SOCKS (make 2)
Leg
With smaller needles, loosely cast on 40 sts. Divide sts evenly onto 4 double
pointed needles, with 10 sts on each needle.
Markers
We used removeable markers for this sock, placing the marker in a stitch and
moving the marker up as we began a new rnd.
Place marker for beginning of rnd and join by working the first st on the left hand
needle with the working yarn from the right hand needle, being careful not to twist
sts.
Rnd 1: *K1, p1; rep from * around.
Rep Rnd 1 for 2 1/2 in. (6.5 cm).
Change to larger needles (by simply knitting onto one larger needle at a time,
and work in St st in the rnd (knit every st on every rnd) until piece measures
about 6 in. (15 cm) from beginning.
Slip the last 20 sts onto a holder. These sts will be used later when shaping the
instep.
Heel flap (worked back and forth in rows on remaining 20 heel sts only)
Row 1 (RS): *Sl 1 as if to purl and with yarn in back, k1; rep from * across.
Row 2: Sl 1 as if to purl and with yarn in front, p across.
Repeat Rows 1 and 2 for 8 more times (18 rows total), end with a Row 2 as the
last row you work.
Turn Heel
NOTES
When you ‘turn’ the heel of a sock, you’re working across just some of the sts in
a row. Turn your work when the pattern tells you to and just leave the remaining
sts unworked.
These partial rows are known as short rows – they help build dimensional shape
into a piece.
When turning the heel, slip sts as follows:
On right side slip as if to purl and with yarn in back
On wrong side slip as if to purl and with yarn in front
Row 1 (RS): Sl 1, k12, ssk, k1, turn (just leave remaining sts unworked).
Row 2: Sl 1, p7, p2tog, p1, turn.

Row 3: Sl 1, knit to 1 st before the small ‘gap’ in your work, ssk (over 1 st on
each side of the gap), k1, turn.
Row 4: Sl 1, purl to 1 st before the gap, p2tog, p1, turn.
Repeat Rows 3 and 4 until all heel sts have been worked, end with a Row 4 as
the last row you work – you’ll have 14 heel sts.
Next Rnd: With first dpn, k across 14 heel sts, with same needle, pick up and
k11 sts along side of heel flap
with 2nd needle work across first 10 sts of instep
with 3rd needle, work across rem 10 sts of instep
with 4th needle pick up and k11 sts along side of heel flap, then k across 7 of the
heel sts that are on the first dpn
You’ll have a total of 56 sts.
The new beginning of the rnd is the beginning of the sts on the first dpn, this is
the center of the sole.
You can place a marker at the beg of the rnd if you like – but we found it easy to
remember where the rnd began and work without a marker.
Shape Gusset
The gusset is the part of the sock that’s along the sides of your ankle.
Rnd 1: Knit.
Rnd 2: K to last 3 sts on 1st needle, k2tog, k1; k across instep sts on second and
third needles; on 4th needle, k1, ssk, k to end of rnd.
Rep Rnds 1 and 2 until 40 sts rem.
Foot
Work even in St st until foot measures about 7 1/2 in. (19 cm) from back of heel,
or about 2 in. (5 cm) less than desired total length.
Shape Toe
Rnd 1: K to last 3 sts on 1st needle, k2tog, k1; on 2nd needle, k1, ssk, k to end;
on 3rd needle, k to last 3 sts, k2tog, k1; on 4th needle, k1, ssk, k to end of rnd.
Rnd 2: Knit.
Rep Rnds 1 and 2 for three more times – 24 sts.
To finish shaping the toe, rep Rnd 1 only until you have just 16 sts remaining.
Cut yarn, leaving an 18 in. (45.5 cm) tail.
Graft toe together.
