Ch 4
Row 1: sc in 2nd ch and across, ch 1, turn
Row 2: (2 sc) in 1st st, sc 1, (2 sc) in last ch, ch 1, turn
Row 3: sc across, ch 1, turn
Row 4: (2 sc) in 1st st, sc to next to last st, (2 sc) in last st, ch 1, turn
Repeat Rows 3 and 4 until you have 13 stitches. Work one row of plain sc.
Grit Stitch: (Any stitch pattern can be used, but the grit stitch makes a really nice headband.)
Row 1: ch 1, (sc, dc) in first stitch, skip one stitch, *(sc, dc) in next stitch, skip one stitch,
repeat from *, sc in last st.
Row 2: ch 1, turn, (sc, dc) in first sc, skip dc, *(sc, dc) in next sc, skip dc, repeat from *, sc
in last sc.
Repeat Row 2 for pattern.
Work your pattern until it reaches approximately 12 inches from the start of your pattern (do
not count the sc). If your stitch stretches a lot (like sc rib), you may want to work less than
12 inches.
When you finish your pattern stitches, continue:
R1 (of decreases): Sc dec 2 st, sc to last 2 st, sc dec, ch 1, turn
R2: sc across, ch 1, turn
Repeat these Rows 1 and 2 until you have 3 stitches remaining. Now you are ready to do the
sc border and ties. Read the entire next section before you begin.
Ch 1, sc around the headband. Sc 3 in corners. When you reach the 3 sc at each end, sc in 1st
2 stitches, then ch approx 7 inches. Slip stitch in 2nd ch and across. When you reach the base,
sc in the 2nd ch again, then continue around. When you get back to where you started, join to
the first sc with a slip stitch. You may want to ss once more for extra stability. Fasten off and
weave in ends.
