GAUGE:
18 sts + 24 rows = 4 in. (10 cm) in St st (k on RS, p on WS) with larger needles;
26 sts = 4 in. (10 cm) in St st with smaller needles.
BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the
size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you
fewer stitches and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm] square, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if
more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
STITCH EXPLANATION:
kfb (knit in front and back) Knit next st without removing it from left needle, then k through back
of same st - 1 st increased.
NOTES:
1. Dress is worked in two identical pieces, Front and Back.
2. The skirt of each piece is worked beginning at lower edge. At the top edge of the skirt, all stitches
are bound off.
3. Stitches are picked up across the bound-off stitches of the skirt for the bodice. Binding off the skirt,
then picking up sts with a smaller needle creates the shaping of this dress.

Skirt
With larger needles cast on 63 (74, 83) sts.
Knit 4 rows.
Change to St st (k on RS, p on WS) and work until piece measures about 9 1/2 (10, 11) in. (24 (25.5, 28) cm) from

next row that you are ready to work will be a RS row.

Bodice
With RS facing and smaller needles, pick up and k43 (50, 56) sts evenly spaced across bound-off edge (top of
skirt).
Note: An easy way to pick up sts evenly is to divide the bound-off edge of the skirt into sections, then pick up sts
within each section. Use pins mark the sections as follows: fold piece in half to find the center, then mark center
with a pin. Fold again to find center of each half of piece, mark each of these points with a pin. The bound-off edge
of the skirt is now divided into quarters. To pick up sts evenly, pick up as follows:
For 12 months size, pick up and k10 sts in first quarter section of skirt, pick up and k 11 sts in each of next 3
quarter sections.
For 2 yrs size, pick up and k12 sts in first section, 13 sts in second section, 12 sts in third section and 13 sts in
