Simple Hat Pattern (the World’s Simplest!)
I wanted a hat for myself that I could knit up quickly and without a pattern. I wanted it simple so I
could knit it on a long plane ride in the dark. I decided that this should also be the world’s
simplest hat pattern – one that might even be suitable for teaching new knitters. Finally, I wanted
it in bulky yarn so it would be faster to finish and warmer on my head.
