GAUGE:
16 sts + 19 rows = 4 in. (10 cm) in St st worked in the rnd (k every rnd) with larger
needles. BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the gauge in a pattern, your
project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern will
be sufficient. If it takes you less stitches and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm] square, try using
a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.

onto left needle. Knit this new stitch through the back loop – 1 st increased.
