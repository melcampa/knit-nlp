GAUGE:
9½ sts and 14 rows = 4" (10 cm) In St st (k on RS, p on WS).
When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and
the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. The needle or hook size called for in the
pattern is based on what the designer used, but it is not unusual for gauge to vary from person to
person. If it takes you fewer stitches and rows to make your swatch, try using a smaller size hook
or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
