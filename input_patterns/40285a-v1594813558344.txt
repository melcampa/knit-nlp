GAUGE:
16 stitches = 4 inches (10 cm) in garter stitch (knit every row). When you match the gauge in a
pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the
pattern will be sufficient. The needle or hook size called for in the pattern is based on what the
designer used, but it is not unusual for gauge to vary from person to person. If it takes you fewer
stitches and rows to make your swatch, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches
and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
Making a Gauge Swatch
SCARF
Cast on 5 stitches. Knit one row.
Knit into the front and back of first stitch – increase made, knit remaining stitches – 6 stitches.
Continue to increase at beginning of each row until there are 12 stitches.
Knit even on 12 stitches until there are 2 yards of yarn left.
Knit 2 stitches together at beginning of next row – decrease made, knit remaining stitches – 11 stitches.
Continue to decrease at beginning of following rows until there are 5 stitches left.
