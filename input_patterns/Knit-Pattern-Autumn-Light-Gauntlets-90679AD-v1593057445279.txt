GAUGE:
18 sts = 4 in. (10 cm) in St st (k on RS, p on WS). BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the
gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the

smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
