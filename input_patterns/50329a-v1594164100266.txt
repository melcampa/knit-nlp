GAUGE:
24 sts + 32 rows = 4 inches [10 cm] in St st (k on RS, p on WS). When you match the gauge in a
pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the
pattern will be sufficient. The needle or hook size called for in the pattern is based on what the
designer used, but it is not unusual for gauge to vary from person to person. If it takes you fewer
stitches and rows to make your swatch, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches
and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
Making a Gauge Swatch
STITCH EXPLANATION:
M1 (make 1 st) An increase worked by lifting the horizontal thread lying between the needles and placing
it onto the left needle. Work this new stitch through the back loop.
skp (slip, knit, pass) A decrease worked by slipping 1 st as if to knit, knitting the next st, then passing
the slipped stitch over the knit st.
