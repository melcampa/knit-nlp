GAUGE:

your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the
pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you less stitches and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm]
square, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size
hook or needles.
