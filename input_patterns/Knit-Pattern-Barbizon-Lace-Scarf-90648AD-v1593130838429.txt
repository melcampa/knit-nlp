GAUGE:

smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or
needles.

NOTES:
1. Scarf is worked in 4 different lace patterns, always keeping the first and last 2 sts
of every row in Seed st.
2. Each lace pattern is worked for 10 in. (25.5 cm).
3. If you’d like to make a shorter scarf, simply work fewer lace sections.
To adjust yarn amount for a shorter scarf, note that each ball of yarn will make about
1 1/2 lace sections.
4. When working first row of each lace pattern, place a st marker between each rep
of lace pattern, for ease in counting your sts.
