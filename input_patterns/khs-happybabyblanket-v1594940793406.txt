Knitted Happy Baby Blanket
If you've never tried working a mitered square pattern, the Homespun Happy Baby
Blanket -- available in both knit and crochet versions -- is a terrific introduction. If you
already know how much fun these are, you'll still want to try this easy pattern. Squares
can be joined as you go or worked separately and sewn together for a more portable
