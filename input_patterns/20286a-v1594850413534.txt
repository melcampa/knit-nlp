GAUGE:
25 stitches = 4 inches (10 cm) in ribbing. When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will
be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. The
needle or hook size called for in the pattern is based on what the designer used, but it is not
unusual for gauge to vary from person to person. If it takes you fewer stitches and rows to make
your swatch, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size
hook or needles.
