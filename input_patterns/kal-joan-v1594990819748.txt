Tassel :
Wrap yarn around a 6" wide piece of cardboard about 100 times or use the Susan Bates Trim Tool to make
a tassel. Attach tassel to point of shawl.
Blocking :
To prevent edges from turning, block the shawl by filling the washing machine with warm water and
adding soap for woolens. Place the shawl in the soapy water and push it down, squeezing it gently to make
sure it is thoroughly wet. Let soak a few minutes and spin the water out. Remove the shawl from the
machine. Fill the washer with same temperature clear water. Put shawl back into the machine and squeeze
it a bit. Rep until the water is clear of soap. Spin. Lay the shawl out on a carpeted floor using the wall as the
top guide. No pins are needed as the yarn clings to the carpet. Smooth it out. Using the finished meas as
your guide, pat it flat and leave until thoroughly dry before taking it up.
