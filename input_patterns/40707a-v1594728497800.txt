GAUGE:
12 stitches = 4 inches [10 cm] in pattern stitch with A. When you match the gauge in a pattern,
your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern
will be sufficient. The needle or hook size called for in the pattern is based on what the designer
used, but it is not unusual for gauge to vary from person to person. If it takes you fewer
stitches and rows to make your swatch, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more
stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.

When changing yarn, leave 7" [18 cm] tails to form fringe.
