GAUGE:
18 sts + 24 rows = 4 in. (10 cm) in Stockinette st (knit on right side, purl on wrong side). BE SURE TO
CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in
the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you fewer stitches
and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm] square, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches
and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
