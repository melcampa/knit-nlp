GAUGE:
14 sts + 18 rows = 4 in. (10 cm) in St st (k on RS, p on WS). BE SURE TO CHECK
YOUR GAUGE. When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size
specified in the pattern and the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. If it
takes you less stitches and rows to make a 4 in. [10 cm] square, try using a smaller
size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
STITCH EXPLANATION:
ssk (slip, slip, knit) Slip next 2 sts as if to knit, one at a time, to right needle; insert left needle into fronts of these 2
sts and knit them tog.
sk2p Slip 1 as if to knit, knit 2 together, pass slipped stitch over—2 sts decreased.
NOTES:
Blankie is worked in connected triangles and blocks (entrelac) as follows:
1.To begin, short rows are worked to create a row of base triangles.
2. A row of blocks is then worked between the triangles. Stitches are picked up along
one edge of a triangle and a block is worked over these stitches and joined to the
stitches of one edge of the next triangle.
3. Additional rows of blocks are worked in the same way over previous rows of blocks.
