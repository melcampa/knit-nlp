8 Balls

GAUGE:
15 sts = 4 in. (10 cm) in pattern. BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE. When you match the
gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and the materials
specified in the pattern will be sufficient. If it takes you less stitches and rows to make a 4
in. [10 cm] square, try using a smaller size hook or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a
larger size hook or needles.
NOTES:
Circular needle is used to accommodate large number of sts. Work back and forth in rows on
circular needle as if working on straight needles.
