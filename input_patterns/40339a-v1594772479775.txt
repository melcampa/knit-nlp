GAUGE:
14 sts = 4 inches [10 cm] in garter stitch (knit every row).
Note Loose quality of this scarf does not require exact gauge.
When you match the gauge in a pattern, your project will be the size specified in the pattern and
the materials specified in the pattern will be sufficient. The needle or hook size called for in the
pattern is based on what the designer used, but it is not unusual for gauge to vary from person to
person. If it takes you fewer stitches and rows to make your swatch, try using a smaller size hook
or needles; if more stitches and rows, try a larger size hook or needles.
Making a Gauge Swatch
SCARF
Cast on 14 stitches.
Knit every row until piece measures 48 inches [122 cm].
Bind off stitches loosely.
FRINGE
Cut 60 strands of yarn approximately 21 inches [53.5 cm] long. For each fringe, hold 5 strands of yarn together and fold
in half. Use crochet hook to draw fold through edge of Scarf, forming a loop. Pull ends of fringe through this loop. Pull to
tighten. Make 6 fringes along each short side with 5 strands of yarn in each fringe. Trim fringe if necessary.
